##DRP Making Friends with Value Types

This is my attempt to wrap my head around the concepts in Andy Matuschak's talk ["Controlling Complexity in Swift — or — Making Friends with Value Types"](https://realm.io/news/andy-matuschak-controlling-complexity/). He presents an interesting two layered approach to setting out your program with a thin imperative shell and a fat functional core. Sounds good but I'm struggling to really make sense of it. As a result I decided to try and flesh out his example in a playground. This is the result. 

Another article from Andy that tackles the same concept. [A Warm Welcome to Structs and Value Types](http://www.objc.io/issue-16/swift-classes-vs-structs.html)

As a side note, this is just my attempt to better understand the concepts presented by Andy Matuschak. I may be way off in many areas. Any corrections are welcome.
